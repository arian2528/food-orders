# Hono Auth Microservice Proxy with Better Auth

This document explains how to implement authentication and user management using the Hono web framework and the Better Auth library. The service acts as a proxy for authentication and user-related data for other applications. All Authentication & User Management will be handled by the Auth proxy defined in the `auth` directory. Multiple Auth proxy APIs can be defined, but only one will be chosen for use. All API endpoints will be proxied through the Auth API to provide security and user role-based access.

## Hono Auth Proxy Overview
- This service acts as a proxy for authentication and user data.
- Other applications (frontends, APIs, microservices) interact with this proxy for all authentication, SSO, and user info needs.
- The proxy issues JWTs after social sign-in and 2FA, and exposes endpoints for user profile, session validation, and role checks.
