# Database Management System (DBMS) and ORM

For this project, the following technologies are used for data persistence and modeling:

## DBMS: PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL is selected as the primary database for its reliability, scalability, and strong support for relational data and advanced queries.
- All application data will be stored in a PostgreSQL instance.

## ORM: Prisma
- Prisma is used as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- Prisma provides type-safe database access, easy schema migrations, and a modern developer experience.

For full details on the database schema and entity relationships, see `database/schema.md`.
